./kcc_platformer_example:
- Example of a Kinematic Character Controller Unity platformer-style implementation
- Player is constrained to Y/Z plane
- Camera is controlled separately by a Cinemachine Brain to facilitate cut-scenes
- Uses new Input System package with event-driven handlers rather than an update loop
- Player can move L/R (A/D keys), jump (W), crouch (S), interact (SPACE) or shoot (E/Left Control)
- Requires Philippe St-Amand's Unity Store asset (https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/physics/kinematic-character-controller-99131) to work
